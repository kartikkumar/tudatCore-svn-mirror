 *    Notes
 *     If you are unable to replicate the error control mechanism for adaptive step size methods,
 *     you can force the integrator to accept all steps taken based on the time-data in the 
 *     benchmark data files. The easiest way to do this is to set the relative and absolute
 *     tolerances to a large value, so that in effect the error control mechanism doesn't kick
 *     in.
