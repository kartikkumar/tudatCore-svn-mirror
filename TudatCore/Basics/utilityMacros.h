//! Suppress compile time unused parameter warnings.
/*!
 * This macro suppresses the warning that a parameter passed to a function/method is not used, but
 * still passed in. This commonly occurs when overriding virtual methods.
 * 
 * Example:
 * int foo( int bar) {
 *     TUDAT_UNUSED_PARAMETER(bar);
 *     return -1;
 * }
 *
 * \param unusedParameter Parameter that is not being used in a function.
 */
#define TUDAT_UNUSED_PARAMETER( unusedParameter ) { ( void ) unusedParameter; }

//! Mark a declaration as deprecated.
/*!
 * When a declaration is marked as deprecated, it should be avoided, as most likely it performs 
 * something unwanted, superseded by another functionality or marked for removal in a future a 
 * release. The user should check where the deprecation warning comes from in order to get
 * information from the developer on how to resolve the warning. Commonly one should use another,
 * recommended function or alternative code block.
 *
 * Snippets:
 * TUDAT_DEPRECATED("Deprecated function!", void f() );
 * TUDAT_DEPRECATED("Deprecated type!",     typedef int my_int);
 * TUDAT_DEPRECATED("Deprecated variable!", int bar);
 *
 * Example:
 * //! Do something. 
 * // Deprecated; use Foo::NewFunc(int, float) instead.
 * // \see Foo::NewFunc(int, float)
 * TUDAT_DEPRECATED("Deprecated, you should use Foo::NewFunc(int, float) instead.",
 *                   void OldFunc(int a, float b));
 *
 * //! Do something better
 * void NewFunc(int a, double b);
 *
 * \param message Warning message to show when compiling. One should mention "Deprecated", and why
 *                  the function was deprecated in a short one liner.
 * \param expression The expression which has to be deprecated.
