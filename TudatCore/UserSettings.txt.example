# If TudatCore is not found, use the following to manually set the path to the TudatCore.
#SET(TUDAT_CORE_BASE_PATH "C:\path\to\TudatCore")

# Enforce a rootpath for either packages or core directory
# This should be used in case the FILE token does not given the full-path in the getRootPath() function in basicFunctions.h.
#add_definitions(-DTUDAT_CUSTOM_ROOT_PATH="C:\My\Custom\Path\To\Tudat")

# If Boost is not found, use the following to manually set the path to the Boost include and library directories.
#SET(BOOST_ROOT       "C:/path/to/boost")
#SET(BOOST_INCLUDEDIR "C:/path/to/boost")
# Set the path to where your build libraries (*.a *.lib) are located
#SET(BOOST_LIBRARYDIR "C:/path/to/boost/stage/lib")

# Additional boost debug settings, to check where things might be wrong:
# Show details for every boost step performed:
#SET(Boost_DEBUG      "TRUE")
# Give more detailed cmake boost error messages:
#SET(Boost_DETAILED_FAILURE_MSG "TRUE")
